**Subject:** Gamify Team Queso’s fanbase — and capture sponsor-ready data

Hi Álvaro,  

I’ve been following Team Queso’s rise across mobile esports and love how you’ve built one of the most passionate Spanish-speaking fan communities. With FanBase’s Quest Widget, you could reward fans for joining Discord, following new rosters, or purchasing merch - while automatically capturing verified data that sponsors love.  

Would you be open to a 20-minute walkthrough to explore a custom TQ-branded quest campaign?  

Best regards,

Hi Adam,  

Oxygen Esports has built a strong regional presence, and your Shopify merch store shows a committed fanbase. FanBase helps teams turn fan interactions into first-party data - rewarding them for predictions, watch-time, and more.  

Could we schedule a short demo to show how quests might boost your next merch launch or event campaign?  

Best regards,
